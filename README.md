My person playground of things I like to do.

This is the personal playground of Tod Price, a.k.a HTRN. This is where I post information on my crafts, interests, hobbies and other things, the Internet community may find of interest.

So what is a HTRN? A HTRN is a High Tech Red Neck. This is a nick name I acquired working the tech industry. Not a real "Redneck", but people in the city thought I was one. I am a person that city people consider maybe a hick or a country boy. Why, because I am different and not part of their rat race. I am happy with the little things in life and very comfortable with technology. I actually find it easy to apply.

In my instance, I live in the middle of the Western Virginia mountains (No not West Virginia), until recently not connected to the power grid and still have all the comforts of any other home. Even before Al Gore invented the Internet and Global Warming.

I live in an antique log cabin, In the middle of nowhere.  Use Solar for electricity, a mountain spring for water, raise a garden, ride a 4-wheeler and ~~commute to the city for employment~~ retired. To further reduce my carbon footprint, I recently (Spring 2007) had the grid connected so that I didn't ever have to run my gas generator. The Grid is our new "backup" power source.

My interests are Woodworking (mostly on the lathe),  Home automaion using Home Assistant and Gardening.
