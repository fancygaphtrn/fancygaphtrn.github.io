I've always thought about the possibilities of getting power from our creek.   I don't know the actual gallons per minute of the creek, but believe it to be around 100 gpm.

Problems come with the:
1. Distances.  From marker 1 to marker 10 is about 600 feet.
2. Flooding events.   Flash floods are common here and it would take substancial structure to not get washed away.
