I've always thought about the possibilities of getting power from our creek.   I don't know the actual gallons per minute of the creek, but believe it to be around 100 gpm.

Problems with implementing:
1. Distances:  From marker 1 to marker 10 is about 600 feet.
2. Flooding events:   Flash floods are common here and it would take substantial structure to not get washed away.
3. Cost:  The diameter of the pipe required and the distance would be expensive.  Let alone the turbine.
